    "about": "My interest in technology started as far back as I can remember. I was the type of kid that would ask for a Walkman and have it disassembled in a matter of minutes, just to see how it worked. I wrote my first program in a high school robotics class. From that moment on I have been fascinated with electronics, software, and connecting the two together. After graduating high school, I decided to go straight into a career path. A great area, which I felt, was a blend of both areas of interest would be working as an electrician. I spent the next 12 years working, primarily on, commercial and industrial electrical installation projects. The projects ranged anywhere from automated lighting systems to industrial scale recycling automation. About 8 years into my career, as an electrician, I felt that I needed to take myself to the next level and focus more on the software aspect. So, I went back to school full-time. Directly out of college I got a job with an insurance company as a developer. This was about the same time as the advent of smart phones. After my first mobile project I found myself very attracted to developing on mobile platforms. The primary reason being it is an intimate technology where we, as developers, get the opportunity to directly impact a user's life. I have since worked on many iOS and Android projects, most recently and notably the Wendy's Mobile Ordering application. Throughout the years I have worked on many aspects of the technology stack ranging from Bluetooth 4 to back-end services and databases. In my free time I like developing anything IoT related, wood working, traveling, hiking, and spending time with my family.",
